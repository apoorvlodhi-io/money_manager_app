# Walley (Money Manager App)
   An intelligent money management solution built to manage your daily expenses and Udharis. The app targets millennials, especially those living in
   hostels and dormitories.<br>
   In such an environment, students tend to borrow and lend money to their batchmates who often forget to pay them back. This app lets you overcome
   this problem by keeping a track of all your expenses and reminding you of all your pending Udhari. <br>
   Moreover, it lets you merge multiple Udharis into a single one to minimize the net flow of money between users by actively scanning all your Udhari!<br>
   No more messy bill splits!
